At CMU, I'm a TA/Grader for 80-180: Introduction to Linguistics (formerly Nature of Language),
taught by [Prof. Tom Werner](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/tom-werner.html){:target="_blank"}.
I've been excited to do this starting more than a year prior to when I got the position.
